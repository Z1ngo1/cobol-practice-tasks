# Task 09 — Client Duplicate Detection (VSAM KSDS + SORT + PS Report)

## Overview

Reads a VSAM KSDS client master file [`CLIENT.MAST.VSAM`](DATA/CLIENT.MAST.VSAM), sorts all records by name and birth date using the internal COBOL `SORT` verb, then groups consecutive records with the same `NAME + BIRTH-DATE` key.
Any group with more than one record is written to a PS duplicate report. A summary is printed to SYSOUT with the total number of records, duplicate groups, and suspicious records found.

## Files

| DD Name | File | Org | Mode | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `VSAMDD` | `CLIENT.MASTER.FILE` | VSAM KSDS | INPUT | Source client master file, key = `CLIENT-ID` |
| `SRTDD` | Sort work file | SD | WORK | Internal sort work area |
| `REPDD` | `DUPLICATE.REPORT` | PS | OUTPUT | Duplicate records report, LRECL=80, RECFM=F |

### VSAM Record Layout (`VSAMDD`) — LRECL=74

| Field | Picture | Offset | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MAST-ID` | `X(6)` | 1 | **Primary key** — client ID |
| `MAST-NAME` | `X(30)` | 7 | Full name |
| `MAST-BIRTH` | `X(8)` | 37 | Birth date (`YYYYMMDD`) |
| `MAST-PASSPORT` | `X(10)` | 45 | Passport number |
| `MAST-CITY` | `X(20)` | 55 | City |

### Report Record Layout (`REPDD`) — LRECL=80, RECFM=F

| Field | Picture | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `CL-ID` | `X(6)` | Client ID |
| FILLER | `X(1)` | Space |
| `CL-NAME` | `X(30)` | Full name |
| FILLER | `X(1)` | Space |
| `CL-BIRTH` | `X(8)` | Birth date |
| FILLER | `X(1)` | Space |
| `CL-PASSPORT` | `X(10)` | Passport number |
| FILLER | `X(23)` | Spaces (padding to 80) |

## Business Logic

### Duplicate Detection Key

Two clients are considered potential duplicates if both conditions match:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| `MAST-NAME` | Full name (`X(30)`) |
| `MAST-BIRTH` | Birth date (`X(8)`) |

### Group Processing Rules

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `GROUP-COUNT > 1` after key change | Write all buffered records to `REPDD`, increment `TOTAL-GROUPS` and `TOTAL-DUPS` |
| `GROUP-COUNT = 1` | Skip — no duplicate, nothing written |
| Buffer overflow (`GROUP-COUNT >= 50`) | Warning to SYSOUT, extra record dropped |

## Program Flow

1. **PERFORM OPEN-REPORT-FILE** — open `REPDD` as OUTPUT
2. **SORT** `CLIENT-SORT-WORK`:
   - Sort keys: `SRT-NAME ASC`, `SRT-BIRTH ASC`, `SRT-ID ASC`
   - Input: `USING CLIENT-MASTER-FILE` (reads `VSAMDD` automatically)
   - Output: `OUTPUT PROCEDURE IS PRCSS-SORT-REC THRU PROCESS-EXIT`
3. **PRCSS-SORT-REC** (OUTPUT PROCEDURE):
   - **RETURN** first record from sort work — save `WS-CUR-NAME`, `WS-CUR-BIRTH`, call `ADD-TO-GROUP-BUFFER`
   - **PERFORM UNTIL EOF:**
     - **RETURN** next sorted record
     - If `SRT-NAME = WS-CUR-NAME` AND `SRT-BIRTH = WS-CUR-BIRTH`:
       - **PERFORM ADD-TO-GROUP-BUFFER** — append to current group
     - Else (key change):
       - **PERFORM WRITE-DUPLICATE-GROUP** — flush previous group if `COUNT > 1`
       - Reset `WS-CUR-NAME`, `WS-CUR-BIRTH`, `WS-GROUP-COUNT = 0`
       - **PERFORM ADD-TO-GROUP-BUFFER** — start new group
   - After loop: **PERFORM WRITE-DUPLICATE-GROUP** — flush last group
4. Check `SORT-RETURN NOT = 0` — `DISPLAY` error and `STOP RUN`
5. **PERFORM CLOSE-REPORT-FILE**
6. **PERFORM DISPLAY-SUMMARY-REPORT** — print statistics to SYSOUT
7. `STOP RUN`

### ADD-TO-GROUP-BUFFER
- If `WS-GROUP-COUNT < 50`: increment counter, store `SRT-ID`, `SRT-NAME`, `SRT-BIRTH`, `SRT-PASSPORT` into `WS-GROUP-TABLE(WS-GROUP-COUNT)`
- Else: `DISPLAY 'WARNING: GROUP BUFFER OVERFLOW'`

### WRITE-DUPLICATE-GROUP
- If `WS-GROUP-COUNT > 1`: increment `TOTAL-GROUPS`, loop through buffer, write each record to `REPDD`, increment `TOTAL-DUPS` per record

## Test Data

Input data and expected output are stored in the [`DATA/`](DATA/) folder:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| [`CLIENT.MAST.VSAM`](DATA/CLIENT.MAST.VSAM) | 10 test client records loaded into VSAM |
| [`DUPLCT.REPORT`](DATA/DUPLCT.REPORT) | Expected duplicate report output |

---

## Expected SYSOUT

Actual job output is stored in [`OUTPUT/SYSOUT.txt`](OUTPUT/SYSOUT.txt).

```
========================================
DUPLICATE REPORT SUMMARY
========================================
TOTAL RECORDS PROCESSED:     10
GROUPS WITH DUPLICATES:        3
SUSPICIOUS RECORDS FOUND:      8
========================================
```

## How to Run

1. **Define VSAM cluster** — run [`JCL/DEFKSDS.jcl`](JCL/DEFKSDS.jcl)
2. **Load initial master data** — load [`DATA/CLIENT.MAST.VSAM`](DATA/CLIENT.MAST.VSAM) into the KSDS cluster either via REPRO (see [`DATAVSAM.jcl`](../../JCL%20SAMPLES/DATAVSAM.jcl)) or manually through **File Manager** in ISPF 
3. **Compile and run** — run [`JCL/COMPRUN.jcl`](JCL/COMPRUN.jcl)

> **PROC reference:** [`JCL/COMPRUN.jcl`](JCL/COMPRUN.jcl) uses the [`MYCOMPGO`](../../JCLPROC/MYCOMPGO.jcl) catalogued procedure for compilation and execution. Make sure [`MYCOMPGO`](../../JCLPROC/MYCOMPGO.jcl) is available in your system's `PROCLIB` before submitting.

## Key COBOL Concepts Used

- `SORT ... USING ... OUTPUT PROCEDURE IS` — internal COBOL sort with a custom output procedure; the `USING` clause reads `CLIENT-MASTER-FILE` automatically, no explicit `OPEN`/`READ`/`CLOSE` needed for the input file
- `SD` (Sort Description) — describes the sort work file record layout used as sort keys
- `RETURN ... AT END` — equivalent of `READ` inside an output procedure; fetches the next sorted record one at a time
- `OUTPUT PROCEDURE ... THRU` — defines a range of paragraphs that process sorted records; must end with `GO TO PROCESS-EXIT` to avoid fall-through
- `OCCURS 50 TIMES` — internal table used as a group buffer; stores up to 50 records per duplicate group before flushing to the report
- Control-break pattern — key-change detection (`IF NAME = CURRENT AND BIRTH = CURRENT`) with end-of-file flush of the last group; classic batch accumulation technique
- `SORT-RETURN` — system field set by COBOL after `SORT`; `0` = success, non-zero = failure
- `ACCESS MODE IS SEQUENTIAL` on KSDS — reads records in primary key order; combined with the sort, guarantees deterministic output order

---

## Known Limitations

- **Group buffer capped at 50 records** — if a duplicate group contains more than 50 entries,
  excess records are silently excluded from `REPDD`. A `WARNING: GROUP BUFFER OVERFLOW` message
  is printed to SYSOUT, but the job continues. `TOTAL-DUPS` will be understated in this case.
- **`SUSPICIOUS RECORDS FOUND` counts all records in a group, not just the extras** — for a
  group of 3 identical clients, the counter increments by 3 (not 2). This is by design: the
  report shows all members of a duplicate group so an analyst can review every record.

## Notes

- The VSAM file is sorted by `CLIENT-ID` (primary key), but duplicates are detected on `NAME + BIRTH-DATE` — that is why an internal `SORT` is required before grouping
- The group buffer holds up to **50 records** per group; if a group exceeds this limit, extra records are dropped with a warning to SYSOUT but do not stop the job
- The last group is flushed **after** the `PERFORM UNTIL EOF` loop ends — without this final `PERFORM WRITE-DUPLICATE-GROUP`, the last group would never be written (classic end-of-file accumulation bug)
- Records with `GROUP-COUNT = 1` are silently skipped and never appear in the report — only confirmed duplicates (2+ records with the same key) are reported
- `SORT-RETURN` is checked after the `SORT` statement completes; a non-zero return code means the sort work file failed or ran out of space
- Tested on IBM z/OS with Enterprise COBOL
